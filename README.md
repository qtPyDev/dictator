# dictator

## what is it ?
dictator is a visual novel creation engine that allows for the fast and user-friendly writing of visual novel logic including scenes, episodes/acts, and chapters

this tool is under development and NOT ready for use yet - if you would like to help contribute, feel free to submit a pull request and i will find time to review it

## goals
- to streamline the visual novel creation process into pre-allocated slots or "scenes", all of which make up an "episode/act" (right now ive called it episode, might rename) which associates itself with a chapter of the vn
- allows inter-scene interaction including "decision" tasking, and eventually custom variable consideration
- engine independent, can be imported into existing engines easily to work with more advanced graphical capabilities
- to be lightning fast 
- to be FOSS (free open source software, free as in open source, and free as in free to use, remix, redistribute, and share)
- to serve as a potential source for some donational support for free-time development expenditure to allow me to continue to produce FOSS
